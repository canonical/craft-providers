    Defines how to setup/configure an environment that has been instantiated by
    a provider and prepare it for some operation, e.g. execute build.  It must
    account for:

    (1) the OS type and version.

    (2) the provided image that was launched, e.g. bootstrapping a minimal image
    versus a more fully featured one.

    (3) any dependencies that are required for the operation to complete, e.g.
    installed applications, networking configuration, etc.  This includes any
    environment configuration that the application will assume is available.

    :cvar compatibility_tag: Tag/Version for variant of build configuration and
        setup.  Any change to this version would indicate that prior [versioned]
        instances are incompatible and must be cleaned.  As such, any new value
        should be unique to old values (e.g. incrementing).  It is suggested to
        extend this tag, not overwrite it, e.g.: compatibility_tag =
        f"{appname}-{Base.compatibility_tag}.{apprevision}" to ensure base
        compatibility levels are maintained.
